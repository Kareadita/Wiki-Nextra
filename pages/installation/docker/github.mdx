# Github Container Registry 

Github also has the latest and nightly releases avilable if you do not want to use dockerhub. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/pkgs/container/kavita)

This is the same image that is uploaded to dockerhub, just on a different container registry.

        image: ghcr.io/kareadita/kavita:latest    # Using the stable branch from ghcr.io

## Docker Run

```bash
docker run --name kavita -p 5000:5000 \
-v /your/manga/directory:/manga \

```

## Nightly Branch

The nightly branch is where the latest features and bug fixes are tested before being merged into the stable branch. Be aware that you can not switch from the nightly branch to the stable branch until the next stable release aligns up again. 

If you do plan on running the nightly branch and plan on helping with the testing process, please join the discord and take the "Kavita Nighly Testing" role. 

<Callout type="info">
	We don't recommend running the nightly as your main instance. There might be show stopping bugs or inefficiencies introduced at any point. 

    It is recommended to run the nightly branch in a separate instance or container than your main instance.
