# Getting Started

## System Requirements

Kavita can run on a wide varity of devices but your experience will be better the more resources you have. Your media files don't need to be on a SSD, but keeping your Kavita database file on a SSD will greatly increase performance of the application. Users have reported running the app on as little as a single core 1Ghz CPU and 256MB RAM. 

The only requirement Kavita has is the need for CPU that supports SSE4.2 extensions. This is because of the upstream library `NetVIPS`. [See the FAQ](../troubleshooting/faq.mdx#q-what-is-the-netvips-dependency-and-what-does-it-mean-if-i-cant-run-it) for how to work around it. 

Users have reported memory usage averages 150-350MB depending on the size of your library. Spikes in memory will occur after scanning but will go back down over time.

## Supported Browsers 

Kavita uses Angular, which supports up to the [2 most recent versions of a web browser](https://angular.io/guide/browser-support). If you use an older web browser you may have compatibility issues, or worst case, not be able to load Kavita at all due to incompatibility.

## Installation methods

Kavita only supports operating systems and enviroments that are still in their support cycle. Running the software using End-of-Life technologies is highly likely to run into issues. 

There are a few ways to get setup running kavita depending on what enviroment you have:

1. Install using [Docker](/installation/docker)
2. Install using a [pre-compiled executable](/installation/native) for your operating system
3. Install on your [NAS or storage applicance](/installation/nas)
