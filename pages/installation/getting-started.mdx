# Getting Started

## System Requirements

Kavita can run on a wide varity of devices but your experience will generally be better the more resources you have. Your media files don't need to be on a SSD, but keeping your Kavita database file on a SSD will greatly increase performance of the application. 

Due to the upstream library `NetVips`, the only requirement to run kavita is a CPU that supports [SSE4.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4) for cover generation. Almost all modern CPU's made in the last 10 years support this. 

If you have an Intel CPU, you can check if your device is supported by looking in [Intel's ARC database](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark.html#@Processors) for your CPU. "Instruction Set Extensions" should list SSE4.2

AMD users can check [wikipedia for their arcitecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMD_CPU_microarchitectures) to see if there is support. 

Users have reported memory usage averages 150-350MB depending on the size of your library. Spikes in memory will occur after scanning but will go back down over time as garbage collection runs.

## Supported Browsers 

Kavita uses Angular, which supports up to the [2 most recent versions of a web browser](https://angular.io/guide/browser-support) If you use an older web browser you may have compatibility issues, or worst case, not be able to load Kavita at all due to incompatibility. 

## Demo

If you want to try out a demo of Kavita first before installing, you can find it at [https://demo.kavitareader.com/](https://demo.kavitareader.com/). The login credentials are:

## Installation methods

Kavita only supports operating systems and enviroments that are still in their support cycle. Running the software using End-of-Life technologies is highly likely to run into issues. 

There are a few ways to get setup running kavita depending on what enviroment you have:

1. Install using [Docker](/installation/docker)
2. Install using a [pre-compiled executable](/installation/native) for your operating system
3. Install on your [NAS or storage applicance](/installation/nas)
