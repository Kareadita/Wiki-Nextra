# Native Install Methods

Pre-built binaries will be available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/releases). Supported platforms are: Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Kavita's releases are made to be used 'out of the box'. This means there is no need to install extra software or dependencies. 

<Tabs items={[' Windows', '🍎 OSX', '🐧 Linux']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

You have 2 options when it comes to running on Windows. You can either use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) or download the pre-built binaries from the GitHub releases page. Running scoop has the added benefit of being able to update Kavita with a single command.

## Scoop Install

Once you have `scoop` installed you can run the following commands to install Kavita. 

```cmd
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install kavita
```

If you also plan on running Kavita as a service then you can run: 
```cmd
scoop install shawl
```

Then see the [optional step](#running-as-a-service-optional) section once you have everything installed. 

If scoop was installed without modifying the default settings then Kavita will now be installed at `%userprofile%\scoop\apps\kavita\current\kavita.exe`

## Install Steps from Github:

<Steps>

<h3> Step 1 </h3>
 
Go to https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/releases/latest and scroll down until you see the 'assets' section where there's a list of files that you can download. 

Download the `kavita-win-x64` if you have a 64-bit system (preferred version - Windows 10 + Windows 11)

Download the `kavita-win-x86` if you have a 32-bit system (usually older devices - Windows 7 and below)

 
<h3> Step 2 </h3>
 
Unzip the archive to a writable directory using a program like [7z](https://www.7-zip.org/)

<Callout type="error">
Do not place it in `Program Files/` or `Program Files (x86)/`

These are protected folders and will have permissions problems!
</Callout>

<h3> Step 3 </h3>

Once the files are extracted to a location, run Kavita.exe to launch the server.

<h3> Step 4 </h3>

Open a browser window and go to: `http://localhost:5000/`

### Running as a service (Optional)

<Callout type="error">
  `nssm` is outdated and has problems with Windows 11.  
</Callout>

We recommend using [shawl](https://github.com/mtkennerly/shawl) to run Kavita as a service. Shawl is a "portable app", you can simply download it and put it anywhere without going through an installer.

If you installed `shawl` with scoop then you can run the steps to set it up as a service:

Open windows explorer and navigate to the folder where Kavita is installed by scoop by pasting in the following path in your address bar:

```cmd copy
%userprofile%\scoop\apps\kavita\current
```

Once you have the path to the Kavita executable, open powershell as administrator. Change out the first path in `cwd` with your folder path you found in the last step, then the second path after the `--` with the path to kavita.exe .

```cmd
shawl add --name Kavita --cwd C:\Users\Diesel\scoop\apps\kavita\current -- C:\Users\Diesel\scoop\apps\kavita\current\Kavita.exe
```

After that you need to set the service to auto start:

```cmd copy
sc config kavita start= auto
```

Then start the service:
  
```cmd copy
sc start kavita
```
<Callout type="info">
  If you get an error when running the command `sc` try using `sc.exe` instead.
</Callout>

After that kavita should be running as a service. You can load up a browser and go to `http://localhost:5000/` to verify that it is running.

<Steps>
<h3> Step 1 </h3>
 
Go to https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/releases/latest and scroll down until you see the 'assets' section where there's a list of files that you can download. The file you want is "kavita-osx-x64.tar.gz".
 
<h3> Step 2 </h3>
 
Unpack Kavita to your User Folder or folder of choice. For example, in Terminal:
```bash
cd ~
mv ~/Downloads/kavita-osx-x64.tar.gz ~
tar -xf kavita-osx-x64.tar.gz
```
<h3> Step 3 </h3>

Make Kavita executable.

```bash
sudo chmod +x ~/Kavita/Kavita
```

<h3> Step 4 </h3>

Disable Gatekeeper for Kavita's folder so that Kavita and all .dll and .dylib files can be opened

```bash
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Kavita/
```

Forgetting to disable Gatekeeper will prevent Kavita from running!

If you get this screen:
![Gatekeeper](/../public/installation/osx-gatekeeper.png "Gatekeeper warning")

That means the command wasn't run on the right folder.

<h3> Step 5 </h3>

```bash
export alias sqlite=sqlite3
```

<h3> Step 6 </h3>

  Start Kavita in Terminal. You need to launch Kavita from within the ~/Kavita folder, or else appsettings.json will fail to be acquired.

  You only need to run `codesign` on the first run

  ```bash
  cd Kavita
  codesign -s - Kavita
  ./Kavita
  ```

<h3> Step 7 </h3>

Open a browser window and go to: `http://localhost:5000/`

<Steps>

<h3> Step 1 </h3>
 
Go to https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/releases/latest and scroll down until you see the 'assets' section where there's a list of files that you can download.

From a terminal, you can use `wget` to download a release.

```bash
wget https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/releases/download/v0.8.5.11/kavita-linux-x64.tar.gz
```
 
<h3> Step 2 </h3>
 
Unpack Kavita to a folder of your choice.
```bash
tar -xzf kavita-linux-x64.tar.gz
```
<h3> Step 3 </h3>

Make Kavita executable.

```bash
sudo chmod +x ~/Kavita/Kavita
```

<h3> Step 4 </h3>

Run the Kavita executable. `./Kavita`

Open a browser window and go to: `http://localhost:5000/`

<h3> Setup Kavita as a service (Optional) </h3>

To have Kavita start in the background at boot, you may install it as a systemd service. Save the following to a file named `kavita.service` in the directory `/etc/systemd/system`

<Callout type="info">
  This file is an example and assumes you have installed Kavita in `/opt/Kavita` and with running it as a separate user. Make sure to customize it to your system.
</Callout>

```bash copy
[Unit]
Description=Kavita Server
After=network.target

[Service]
User=kavita
Group=kavita
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/Kavita
ExecStart=/opt/Kavita/Kavita
TimeoutStopSec=20
KillMode=process
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

To create a user matching the following configuration file, you need to add a user and a group named `kavita`.

```bash
sudo adduser kavita
```

This creates both a user and a group named `kavita`, and also adds the user to the group.

Now you need to change the owner of the directory you installed Kavita in:

```bash
sudo chown -R kavita:kavita /opt/Kavita
```

Once the service configuration file is saved you can run `systemctl start kavita.service` to test if it starts correctly. If does, run `systemctl enable kavita.service` and it will start at boot for your system. To check the status of the service, you can run `systemctl status kavita.service`. If the service doesn't seem to start, you can use `journalctl` to get more detailed information about any errors that might have occurred.
