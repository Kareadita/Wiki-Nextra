Pre-built binaries will be available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/releases), Supported platforms are: Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Kavita's releases are made to be used out of the box. This means there's no need to install extra requirements

<Steps>
### Step 1
 
Go to https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/releases/latest and scroll down until you see the 'assets' section where there's a list of files that you can download
 
### Step 2
 
Unzip the archive to a writable directory with the command `tar -xzf kavita-linux-{arch}.tar.gz`

### Step 3

Use `chmod` and `chown` commands so Kavita can write to the directory you placed it in.

### Step 4

Run Kavita executable. Usually `./Kavita`

### Setup Kavita as a service (Optional) 

To have Kavita start in the background at boot, you may install it as a systemd service. Save the following to a file named `kavita.service` in the directory /etc/systemd/system

<Callout type="info">
  This file is an example and assumes you have installed Kavita in `/opt/Kavita` and with running it as a separate user. Make sure to customize it to your own syetem.
</Callout>

```bash copy
[Unit]
Description=Kavita Server
After=network.target

[Service]
User=kavita
Group=kavita
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/Kavita
ExecStart=/opt/Kavita/Kavita
TimeoutStopSec=20
KillMode=process
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Once the file is saved you can run `systemctl start kavita.service` to test if it starts correctly. If does, run `systemctl enable kavita.service` and it will start at boot for your system.

<Steps>
### Step 1
 
Go to https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/releases/latest and scroll down until you see the 'assets' section where there's a list of files that you can download. The file you want is "kavita-osx-x64.tar.gz".
 
### Step 2
 
Unpack Kavita to your User Folder or folder of choice. For example, in Terminal:
```bash
cd ~
mv ~/Downloads/kavita-osx-x64.tar.gz ~
tar -xf kavita-osx-x64.tar.gz
```

### Step 3

Make Kavita executable.

```bash
sudo chmod +x ~/Kavita/Kavita
```

### Step 4
Disable Gatekeeper for Kavita's folder so that Kavita and all .dll and .dylib files can be opened
```bash
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Kavita/
```

Forgetting to disable Gatekeeper will prevent Kavita from running!
If you get this screen:
![Gatekeeper](/../public/installation/osx-gatekeeper.png "Gatekeeper warning")

That means the command wasn't ran on the right folder.


### Step 5
```bash
export alias sqlite=sqlite3
```

### Step 6

Start Kavita in Terminal. You need to launch Kavita from within the ~/Kavita folder, or else appsettings.json will fail to be acquired.

```bash
cd ~/Kavita
./Kavita
```

### Step 7
Open a browser window, at address: http://localhost:5000/

## Install Steps from Github:

<Steps>
### Step 1
 
Go to https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/releases/latest and scroll down until you see the 'assets' section where there's a list of files that you can download. 

Download the `kavita-win-x64` if you have a 64-bit system (preferred version - Windows 10 + Windows 11)

Download the `kavita-win-x86` if you have a 32-bit system (usually older devices - Windows 7 and below)

 
### Step 2
 
Unzip the archive to a writable directory using a program like [7z](https://www.7-zip.org/)

<Callout type="error">
Do not place it in `Program Files/` or `Program Files (x86)/`

These are protected folders and will have permissions problems!
</Callout>

### Step 3

Once the files are extracted to a location, you just need to run Kavita.exe to launch the server.
