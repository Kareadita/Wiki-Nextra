# NAS Appliances

Kavita can run on a wide variety of devices and NAS's. Each manufacturer goes about things slightly differently, so make sure to follow your device instructions. 

<Callout type="info">
While Kavita can be installed on most systems, you should still check with your device manufacturer to make sure your desired install method is supported. Some devices are too old to run docker, but will able to run Kavita natively.

#### Synology Install Steps

Synology can be installed either manually by using an appropriate [Linux](native) build or via [docker install](/installation/docker/install)

## QNAP Install Steps

While the Kavita team does not own any QNAP devices, there does exist an image maintained by a third party.
You can find it [here](https://www.forum-nas.fr/threads/kavita-net-apache80-0-5-1-1-a-fast-feature-rich-cross-platform-reading-server.16507/) 

If your QNAP device is capable of running docker, users have reported that the standard [docker install](/installation/docker/install) works. This will enable you to stay up to date and even partake in nightly testing releases.

### Step 1 - Installing for TruNAS

In your server's filesystem, create a folder for your library and a folder for Kavita's config.

### Step 2 

Install the TrueCharts app catalog, search for Kavita, and click "install".

### Step 3 

Modify the following sections:

`Application Name`
	
Set the application name to whatever you want.

`Storage and Persistence`
	
Set the storage type for "App Config Storage" to "HostPath (Simple)" and set the path to your config folder.
		
Set the storage type for "Manga Storage" to "HostPath (Simple)", and set the path to your library folder. This will mount to `/manga` within Kavita.

<Callout type="info">
Leave all other sections at their default settings. Continue to the end and click "Save". 
</Callout>

### Step 4

To access Kavita, go to the Installed Applications page and click Kavita's "Open" button.
