While we recognize that most people want to access their system remotely, we do not provide support for any remote access tools. Any issues based around remote access should be brought up with the devs/support group of the remote access tool used.

# Reverse Proxy
### What is a [Reverse Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy)?

A Reverse Proxy allows you to share web-based services, like Kavita, outside your home network through the upload bandwidth of your home internet connection.

This can be accomplished in several ways including a purchased domain name, a free domain name service such as [NoIP.com](https://www.noip.com/) (or others like it) in combination with some form of Dynamic DNS.

All the example configurations listed here are user submitted. If you would like to contribute your working Reverse Proxy config please join us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/b52wT37kt7) to discuss. 

### Config Examples

* [Apache2 Example](remote-access/apache2-example)
* [Caddy Example](remote-access/caddy-example)
* [HAPROXY Example](remote-access/haproxy-example)
* [NGINX Example](remote-access/nginx-example)
* [NGINX Proxy Manager Example](remote-access/npm-example)
* [SWAG Example](remote-access/swag-example)

# VPN

<Callout type="info">
  It is important to note that when we say VPN here we do not mean commerical VPN services like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, etc. We are talking about a private VPN tool like Tailscale or running your own VPN server.
</Callout>

Using a private VPN tool like Tailscale has the benefit of not requiring any port forwarding, and it's more secure than exposing your server to the internet. If you plan to host your Kavita for just yourself or 1-2 other people and don't want to have public access to your server, you should use a VPN. 

I recommend using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) for this purpose. It's a free, easy to setup VPN which doesn't require any technical skill.

Watch the video to see how to setup Tailscale on your server:
