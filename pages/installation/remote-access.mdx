While we recognize that most people want to access their system remotely, we do not provide an avenue for support. Any issues based around remote access should be brought up with the devs/support group of the remote access tool used.

# Reverse Proxy
### What is a [Reverse Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy)?

A Reverse Proxy allows you to share web-based services, like Kavita, outside your home network through the upload bandwidth of your home internet connection.

This can be accomplished in several ways including a purchased domain name, a free domain name service such as [NoIP.com](https://www.noip.com/), etc in combination with some form of Dynamic DNS.

We will not cover how to achieve this here, but we will provide resources and examples of common Reverse Proxy configuration files.

If you would like to contribute your working Reverse Proxy config please join us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/b52wT37kt7) to discuss. 

### Config Example

* [Apache2 Example](remote-access/apache2-example)
* [Caddy Example](remote-access/caddy-example)
* [HAPROXY Example](remote-access/haproxy-example)
* [NGINX Example](remote-access/nginx-example)
* [NGINX Proxy Manager Example](remote-access/npm-example)
* [SWAG Example](remote-access/swag-example)

# VPN
If you plan to host your Kavita for yourself and don't want to have public access to your server you should set up a VPN. 

Users usually recommend using [Zerotier](https://www.zerotier.com/) for this purpose. It's a free easy to setup VPN. Which doesn't require any technical skill.

To set up:
- Create an account on the main page and create a network
- Install the app on both the server and any device you wish to use
- Join the created network on your devices
- Authorize the devices in the network main panel
- Connect to your apps using the new tailscale IP address
