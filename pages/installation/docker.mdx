# Docker

There is a few options when it comes to docker images. Just note that LSIO doesn't offer ARMv7 support (32-bit Rasberry Pi's) or Nightly images. 

| Method                          |                                Description                                  | Notes                                                                      | 
| ------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| [LinuxServer.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/kavita)                  |           Only offers stable versions. Please see LSIO's website for their own instructions on how to run the container. The rest of the options on this page won't apply here.|  No 32bit ARM support (armv7), no nightly testing branch |
| [Kavita DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jvmilazz0/kavita)                | The primary dockerhub account for Kavita.  | Nightly Testing + official 32-bit ARM images |
| [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/kareadita/Kavita/pkgs/container/kavita) |    Another option in case you don't want to use dockerhub.      | Nightly Testing + official 32-bit ARM images | 

<Callout type="info">
	Docker Compose is the recommended way to run containers. Only use `docker run` if you know what you are doing. ðŸ’ª

<Tabs items={['docker-compose.yml / Portainer Stacks', 'docker run']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  The contents of the compose file can be pasted directly into software like [Dockage](https://github.com/louislam/dockge) or [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/). Otherwise, create the docker-compose.yml file in the folder you want to run it from and execute `docker compose up -d`

<Callout type="warning">
	This is just a template for setting up your docker compose file. Make sure to modify the folder paths to point to your own media.

```yaml
services:
    kavita:
        image: jvmilazz0/kavita:latest    # Using the stable branch from the official dockerhub repo.
        container_name: kavita
        volumes:
            - ./manga:/manga            # Manga is just an example you can have the name you want. See the following
            - ./comics:/comics          # Use as many as you want
            - ./books:/books            #
            - ./data:/kavita/config     # Change './data if you want to have the config files in a different place.
                                        # /kavita/config must not be changed
        environment:
            - TZ=Your/Timezone
        ports:
            - "5000:5000" # Change the public port (the first 5000) if you have conflicts with other services
        restart: unless-stopped
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```bash
docker run --name kavita -p 5000:5000 \
-v /your/manga/directory:/manga \
-v /your/storage/directory/kavita:/kavita/config \
--restart unless-stopped \
-e TZ=Your/Timezone \
-d jvmilazz0/kavita:latest
```

If you prefer bind mounts, you can swap out the two `--volume` lines with:

```bash
--mount type=volume,source=/your/storage/path/kavita,target=/config \
--mount type=volume,source=/your/storage/path/kavita,target=/data \
```
