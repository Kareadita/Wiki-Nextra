As long as Kavita is in a 'stack' then updating is simple:

<Steps>

### Step 1
Go to your stacks on the left sidenav of portainer

![stacks](../../../public/guides/updating/portainer-stacks.png "Portainer Stacks")

### Step 2 

Go into your Kavita stack in the main listing of available stacks.

### Step 3 

Go to the editor tab

![editor](../../../public/guides/updating/portiner-editor.png "Portainer Editor Screen")

### Step 4

![update](../../../public/guides/updating/portainer-actions.png "Portainer Editor Screen")

Go straight to the 'Update the stack' Button and click it. When the dialog box comes up asking "Are you sure?", check the box "Re-pull image and redeploy"

### Clean up

Don't forget to remove any orphaned images in the 'Images' tab so they don't keep taking up space. 

</Steps>

  <Tabs.Tab>
Navigate to the location your compose file is at and run:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

This will pull the most recent image and bring the container back up.

  <Tabs.Tab>
```bash
docker compose pull
```

Then the same `docker run` command you used to bring up the service the first time.
