# Updating Kavita

<Callout type="error">
Remember to use the new [Docker Central Repo!](https://hub.docker.com/r/jvmilazz0/kavita) The old repo `kizaing/kavita` is no longer supported!
</Callout>


<Callout type="warning">
	If you are updating from a really old version you need to upgrade every 2 versions at a time. Doing otherwise you risk to having to restart with a fresh database.
	
	If you are on 0.7.6+ you can update directly to 0.7.13 otherwise you need to update incrementally to prevent data loss (v0.5.6 > v0.7.1.4 > v0.7.3.1 > v0.7.6 > v0.7.13)
</Callout>

  <Tabs.Tab>
Navigate to the location your compose file is at and run:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

This will pull the most recent image and bring the container back up.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```bash
docker compose pull
```

Then your same `docker run` command you used to bring up the service the first time.
