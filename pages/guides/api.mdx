# API

## Authentication

For writing custom scripts that access Kavita's API, you will need to authenticate against the API first. You can do this by sending a POST request to the [`/api/Plugin/authenticate`](https://www.kavitareader.com/docs/api/#/Plugin/post_api_Plugin_authenticate) endpoint with an API key. It will return a JWT User Token back that you can send in all your headers going forward. 

You don't want to directly use JWT tokens in your scripts. They expire and rotate out on a frequent basis. API keys do not expire an only change if the user manually requests a new key.

Using the API key will always give you a valid JWT token. 

## Swagger UI

Kavita's REST API is documented using Swagger, however the UI is disabled for non-dev instances. You can see [Kavita's API Docs](https://www.kavitareader.com/docs/api/#/) on the main kavita website.

## OpenAPI

The link to the OpenAPI file is located here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kareadita/Kavita/develop/openapi.json

## Python Example

Here's a small example written in Python for connecting to the `/api/Plugin/authenticate` endpoint, sending the API key, taking the 'token' response to add to the headers, then hitting the scan_endpoint with the JWT_Token attached in the headers.

```python copy
import requests
import json
from urllib.parse import urlparse

url = input("Paste in your full ODPS URL from your Kavita user dashboard (/preferences#clients): ")

parsed_url = urlparse(url)

host_address = parsed_url.scheme + "://" + parsed_url.netloc
api_key = parsed_url.path.split('/')[-1]

login_endpoint = "/api/Plugin/authenticate"
try:
    apikeylogin = requests.post(host_address + login_endpoint + "?apiKey=" + api_key + "&pluginName=pythonScanScript")
    apikeylogin.raise_for_status() # check if the response code indicates an error
    jwt_token = apikeylogin.json()['token']
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print("Error during authentication:", e)
    exit()

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {jwt_token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
scan_endpoint = "/api/Library/scan-all"
response = requests.post(host_address + scan_endpoint, headers=headers)
```
