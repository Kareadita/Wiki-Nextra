## Authentication

### Sessions

You can get your JWT token by opening dev tools on a browser you have authenticated against and getting this key "kavita-user" from local storage. This will have a token key within it. Use "Bearer TOKEN_KEY" to authenticate. This must be on all APIs for Kavita to respond.

## Swagger UI

Kavita's REST API is documented using Swagger, however the UI is disabled for non-dev instances. You can see [Kavita's API Docs](https://www.kavitareader.com/docs/api/#/) on the main kavita website.
