Kavita supports the Koreader Progress Sync plugin for epubs.

Custom server address to 'https://your-kavita.com/api/koreader/{api-key}'.
Use your username on the login page, but the password can be anything.

It's recommended to use (ODPS)[./odps] to download the desired book to your Koreader, as it will ensure the book is an exact copy of the file hosted on Kavita.

Some Caveats:
* You must have the book in kavita. Books are determined to be the same if their hashes match. (essentially, they must be an exact copy.)
* You may need to rescan your library if updating from a previous version that doesn't support koreader progress sync.
* Kavita only supports progress sync using binary matching. Koreader sets this by default, but if you experience any issues, make sure Binary is selected in the Koreader's document matching method.
* Kavita does not (and will never) support user registration via Koreader.
