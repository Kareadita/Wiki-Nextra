## Setup

To make the extension link with your Kavita instance we need the OPDS URL.
The steps to get the OPDS URL are:

Access your Kavita instance from your web browser and log in
1. Access your Kavita user dashboard
2. Switch to "3rd Party Clients" tab
3. Copy the text under the OPDS URL

**Once the  OPDS URL is obtained open Mihon**
4. Go back to the Mihon extensions tab
5. Tap Kavita
6. Tap the gear icon in one of the sources. (sources explained in customization)
7. Tap OPDS URL setting

## Customization
Once installed the user has access to 3 sources. This means you can have access to 3 different Kavita servers.<br/>
On each source, you can set up different OPDS URLs and different filter preferences. By default, these are differentiated with a number. 1, 2 and 3. You can change each identifier with your own name.<br/>

#### To change the name of the source

Follow the same process used for OPDS but tapping "Displayed name for source" instead.

#### Remove filters from filter list
The same process is used for OPDS but tapping "Default filters shown" instead. This will hide or show filters appearing in the filter list.  To hide one filter just uncheck the checkbox

## Sync Progress with Kavita
Kavita has progress sync with Mihon. It will automatically mark completed volumes and chapters as read in both apps. It does not sync page progress, it only syncs when a volume (or chapter if they are split) is complete.

To activate tracking go to settings > Tracking and click on Kavita at the bottom.

After activating it will appear with the rest of the trackers on your manga page. Make sure it shows its active otherwise it will not sync.
