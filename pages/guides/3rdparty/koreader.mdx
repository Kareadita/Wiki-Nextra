### Setup KOReader for usage with Kavita [#setup-with-kavita]

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">For the purpose of this guide, a working KOReader setup is assumed.
Also, please be aware that your screen may look different from the screenshots, based on your screen size.</Callout>

#### Run a full **FORCED SCAN** of the library you want to sync against

  Click the leftmost button of the **Edit Library** dialog (see picture below for reference). 

  <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  
  This is required __**ONCE**__, when the library has been created before v0.8.7.
  
  It will generate the hash for existing books, books that are added afterwards will have the hash generated when they're added.
  
  </Callout>

#### Setting up the OPDS source

KOReader supports the OPDS standard, which we will use to make your Kavita Library accessible.

You will need to retrieve the [OPDS URL](/guides/user-settings/3rdpartycilents/#opds-url) from your settings.

<Steps>
##### Open the OPDS catalog list

In the File Browser, open the menu, tap the Looking Glass (üîç), and look for the menu entry "OPDS Catalog"

##### Add the Kavita Catalog

- Tap the plus sign in the upper left
<Image src={OPDS2_1} alt="OPDS catalog add" width={250} height={100} />

- Fill out the dialog
<Image src={OPDS2_2} alt="Add OPDS catalog modal" width={250} height={400} />
|Field|Value|
|:----:|:----:|
|Catalog Name|A name of your choosing|
|Catalog URL|Your OPDS URL|
|Username|Your account username|
|Password|Can be anything|

</Steps>
#### Setting up Progress Synchronization

Since v0.8.7, Kavita supports 2-way sync of your reading progress. However, it needs to be enabled in KOReader first.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">You will need the [API key](/guides/user-settings/3rdpartycilents/#api-key) to set up progress sync</Callout>

<Steps>

##### Open any Book

The relevant plugin is only displayed when actually reading a book.

##### Setup the Custom Sync Server

- Open the menu "Plugins" by tapping the icon below in the menu bar, then Progress Sync.
<Image src={SYNC_ICON} alt="KOReader plugin menu icon" width={64} height={64} />
- Tap "Custom Sync Server"
- In the dialog, that pops up now, enter `<your-kavita-server>/api/koreader/<your-api-token>`
- Tap 'Register / Login'
- Login with your username/password
</Steps>

With this, you can now push/pull reading progress to/from Kavita.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">The automatic sync can potentially undo reading progress. We **strongly** advise against using it. We also cannot support you on recovering potentially lost progress.</Callout>
