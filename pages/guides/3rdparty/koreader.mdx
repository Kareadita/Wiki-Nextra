### Setup KOReader for usage with Kavita [#setup-with-kavita]

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">For the purpose of this guide, a working KOReader setup is assumed.
Also, please be aware that your screen may look different from the screenshots, based on your screen size.</Callout>

#### Run a full **FORCED SCAN** of the library you want to sync against

  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  
  This is required __**ONCE**__, when the library has been created before v0.8.7.
  
  It will generate the hash for existing books, books that are added afterwards will have the hash generated when they're added.
  
  </Callout>

  Click the leftmost button of the **Edit Library** dialog (see picture below for reference).

#### Setting up the OPDS source

KOReader supports the OPDS standard, which we will use to make your Kavita Library accessible.

You will need to retrieve the [OPDS URL](/guides/user-settings/3rdpartycilents/#opds-url) from your settings.

<Steps>
##### Open the OPDS catalog list

In the File Browser, open the menu, tap the Looking Glass (🔍), and look for the menu entry "OPDS Catalog"

<Image src={OPDS1} alt="OPDS catalog menu entry" width={250} height={400}/>

##### Add the Kavita Catalog

- Tap the plus sign in the upper left
<Image src={OPDS2_1} alt="OPDS catalog add" width={250} height={100} />

- Fill out the dialog
<Image src={OPDS2_2} alt="Add OPDS catalog modal" width={250} height={400} />
|Field|Value|
|:----:|:----:|
|Catalog Name|A name of your choosing|
|Catalog URL|Your OPDS URL|
|Username|Your account username|
|Password|Can be anything|

</Steps>
#### Setting up Progress Synchronization

Since v0.8.7, Kavita supports 2-way sync of your reading progress. However, it needs to be enabled in KOReader first.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">You will need the [API key](/guides/user-settings/3rdpartycilents/#api-key) to set up progress sync</Callout>

<Steps>

##### Open any Book

The relevant plugin is only displayed when actually reading a book.

##### Setup the Custom Sync Server

- Open the menu "Plugins" by tapping the icon below in the menu bar, then Progress Sync.
<Image src={SYNC_ICON} alt="KOReader plugin menu icon" width={64} height={64} />
- Tap "Custom Sync Server"
- In the dialog, that pops up now, enter `<your-kavita-server>/api/koreader/<your-api-token>`
- Tap 'Register / Login'
- Login with your username, the password can be anything
</Steps>

With this, you can now push/pull reading progress to/from Kavita.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">The automatic sync can potentially undo reading progress. We **strongly** advise against using it. We also cannot support you on recovering potentially lost progress.</Callout>

#### Archive (CBR/CBZ files) Streaming

We do not have KOReader Sync Server setup with archives at this time, KOReader does however make use of the OPDS-PS standard which Kavita supports.

- Open OPDS Catalog
- Select Kavita Server
- Navigate to any book in archive form and press it

For an unread book the option on the left "Page Stream" will bring you to page 1. The second option on the right "Stream From Page" will start you on a page you choose. When a book has been streamed there will be a third resume streaming option.
