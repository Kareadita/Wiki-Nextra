### Comics Structure
<Callout type="info">
	 Make sure you understand the [folder requirements](/guides/scanner#file-layout) of Kavita
</Callout>

Kavita parses Comics just like it does Manga but uses additional keyword identifiers. If you are having trouble, you might want to look at the different cases we have in [our code](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/blob/develop/API.Tests/Parser/ComicParserTests.cs) and what is supported. The following will give you a glimpse.

The same naming conventions work with Comics.
```
┖── Series Name
    ┠── Series Name v01.cbz
    ┠── Series Name v02.cbz
    ┖── Series Name v03 c01.cbz
```



The following will be parsed as "Chapters", which may naturally group into a Volume entity if a volume is on the file itself.

| Filename                                                                               | Parsed Series Name | Volume | Chapter |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------:|:-------|:--------|
| `Invincible 070.5 - Invincible Returns 1 (2010) (digital) (Minutemen-InnerDemons).cbr` |                    |        | 70.5    |
| `Batman & Wildcat (1 of 3)`                                                            |                    |        | 1       |
| `Amazing Man Comics chapter 25`                                                        |                    |        | 25      |
| `Superman v1 024 (09-10 1943)`                                                         |                    | 1      | 24      |
| `Y - The Last Man `                                                                    |                    |        | 1       |
| `Batgirl Vol.2000 #57 (December, 2004)`                                                |                    |        | 57      |
| `Babe 01`                                                                              |                    |        | 1       |
| `Babe T1 01`                                                                           |                    |    1    | 1       |

<Callout type="info">
	 If you have multiple comics from different years, you can name them as "Fables {2004}" and "Fables {1989}" or better yet, use the [Comic Vine](/guides/scanner/comicvine) library type.
     Anything withing () will be stripped during parsing as there is usually junk in there. Use {} or embedded metadata. 
</Callout>

Comics also have a list of special filename keywords that will mark them as specials. Some of these are:
* Specials
* Annual
* Extra Chapter
* Book
* Compendium
* OneShot
* Extra
* FCBD
* TPB
* Side Stories
* Art Collection
* Absolute 
* Preview
* Omnibus
* Bonus
* Hors Série
* HS
* THS

<Callout type="info">
	 The "[Format metadata field](/guides/metadata/comics#format)" for the [ComicInfo metadata](/guides/metadata/comics#conversion-table) can also be used to mark the comic as a special.
