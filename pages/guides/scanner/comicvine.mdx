# Comic Vine Library Type

Comic Vine library type is built around users that have full metadata embedded in their files. This usually means Mylar users, but can be anyone who writes `Comicinfo.xml` into their files.
This library type is much more strictly aligned and matches the structure the [CBL project](https://github.com/DieselTech/CBL-ReadingLists) expects. 

```
Library Root
  ┖── Series Name (Starting Volume Year)
      ┠── Series Name (Vol Year) #01.cbz
      ┠── Series Name (Vol Year) #02.cbz
      ┠── Series Name (Vol Year) #03.cbz
  ┖── Series Name 2 (Starting Volume Year)
      ┠── Series Name 2 #01.cbz
      ┠── Series Name 2 #02.cbz
      ⋮
      ┖── Series Name 2 #06.cbz
```

Rules:
- Kavita will first parse the Volume and Series from the folder name. The expected format is `Series (Volume Year)`
- If there is a ComicInfo, Kavita will override with `Series (Volume)`. It is expected that the Volume is the year and not a single number (however this will still work)
- If there is bad information from both, Kavita will attempt to parse information for each directory from the file to the library root. 
- Kavita will still attempt to classify specials by filename (subject to change) and Format.
