### Image Structure

Images offer no metadata support and have a very simple mechanism for parsing:
- Series is set to the directory name and cleaned
- Volume and Chapters are attempted to parse from folders up to the library root
- If none are found, every image will be treated as a special

This library type is designed to be used for Manga and uses those parsing patterns for Volume/Chapter extraction. 

### Example
```
┖── Series Name
    ┠── Volume 1
        ┠── Chapter 1
            ┠── 01.png
    ┠── Chapter 2
        ┖── 01.png
```
