# Updating 

How you update Kavita is dependent on how you installed it. 

Kavita is built as a stand-alone (portable) program. That means there is no official installer or uninstaller. 

Check out the guides for [docker](updating/updating-docker.mdx) and [native installs](updating/updating-native.mdx).
