## [Kavita to Obsidian](https://github.com/davidlbowman/kavita-to-obsidian)

This plugin pulls all your annotations, highlights, and notes from Kavita and saves them as a beautifully formatted markdown file in your Obsidian vault. Your highlights become searchable, linkable, and integrated with the rest of your notes.
