### Notes
ComicTagger is best used for "western comics". You'll need an account with [ComicVine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/) or [Metron](https://metron.cloud/accounts/signup/) to use the application. 

While ComicVine does have some manga in its database, it's nowhere as much as comics. If the series you are trying to find is not found in the database then fetching metadata from the service won't work.

	If you are working solely with Manga, it's best to use [MangaManager](mangamanager.mdx)
