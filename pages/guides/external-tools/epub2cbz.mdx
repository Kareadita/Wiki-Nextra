## [epub2cbz](https://github.com/bust4cap/epub2cbz)
epub2cbz will extract images from an image based epub (usually a comic or manga) and will pack it as a cbz, a zip file renamed to identify it as a "comic" file and tells applications it may have a comicinfo inside.
* Extracts images in order based on metadata and packs as a cbz.
* Option to create a comicinfo from the epub metadata.
* Bulk processes an entire folder at once.
