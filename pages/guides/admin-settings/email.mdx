In this tab, you can configure the email service Kavita uses for Send To device, User registration, and Forgot Password. 

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠">
  As of version 0.7.13.0 Kavita no longer sends emails using the built-in account.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
  You no longer need to use the Kavita-Email external program. This functionality has been built directly into Kavita.
</Callout>

You need to configure an email server to use the Invite by email, forget password and send to device functionality.

### Shutdown of built-in emailer

With the release of 0.8.0 stable on 4/14/24, the emailer built into Kavita was shut down. This functionality still exists and can be used, it will just require the user to set up their email account inside Kavita. 

### Migrating from Kavita-Email
To use the new email server built into the main application of Kavita going forward you can just transfer your settings from Kavita-Email.

These are the same exact settings you were using already, just not built-in. 

### Gmail users
You'll need to set up an "App Password" to use the email service with your existing email account.
