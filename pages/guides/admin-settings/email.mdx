In this tab, you can configure the email service Kavita uses for Send To device, User registration, and Forgot Password. 

### Shutdown of built-in emailer

With the release of 0.8.0 stable on 4/14/24, the emailer built into Kavita was shut down. This functionality still exists and can be used, it will just require the user to set up their email account inside Kavita. 

### Migrating from Kavita-Email
To use the new email server built into the main application of Kavita going forward you can just transfer your settings from Kavita-Email.

These are the same exact settings you were using already.

## App passwords
Some email providers now are requiring app passwords for third-party applications to send emails.
