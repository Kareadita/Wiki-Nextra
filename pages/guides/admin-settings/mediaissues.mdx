#### Scrobble Issues

Server-wide dashboard of any series that is having problems scrobbling to an external provider. This list will allow you to go directly to a series so you can match it with the properly linked series page with an external provider. 

Series usually appear here if they are named wrong and can't match to the provider, or if they just don't exist yet on the provider.
