### Media Issues


Any problems that Kavita detects with your files will show up here. Kavita will remove issues as it detects the files corrected for `File Format` or `Archive cannot be read` issues.

See [Common Media Issues](../../troubleshooting/media-errors.mdx) for some examples of general problems and how to fix them.
