### Resetting your license

You can now reset your own license if you want to move installs to a different machine. This avoids having to contact the dev in order to change your keys.

To reset your license, click 'edit' and then fill out your `License Key` and `Email` you used to sign up. Pressing the 'Reset' button will remove your license file. It may take up to 10 seconds for this to process.

Once the license is removed from the existing instance you can register your key on another instance. This allows you to self-service reset as needed.
