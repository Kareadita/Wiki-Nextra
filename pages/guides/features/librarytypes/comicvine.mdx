Uses strict comic regex to parse files, expects embedded metadata. UI uses Comic terminology. Metadata/Mylar aligned. 

When can it be used: Only on ComicVine library type
Filetypes: Archive by default. Will always ignore cover.ext in the series directory
How it works:
Series name is formulated first by checking comicInfo Series + Volume
Falls back to Folder and checks explicitly for Series (Volume) format. Does this up until the library root.
Falls back to just the folder name as the Series
