## Metadata Filtering
Kavita has a rich metadata interface that allows you to build complex filters to find exactly what you're looking for. The system allows you to build a series of statements that AND or OR together with custom sorting and a limit feature for those that have large libraries. 

These filters are dynamic and will update as you change the values. If you add new series with metadata that matches the filter, they will automatically be added to the results.

### Smart Filters
A Smart Filter is essentially a saved filter. The underlying filter can be loaded and changed and anything that is bound with the Smart Filter will automatically be reflected in the new filters. Once you have a Smart Filter created, check out [Customization](https://wiki.kavitareader.com/en/guides/customization) to learn about how you can utilize the filters.

To create a Smart Filter, just add a name in the Name field and hit Save. Smart Filter names must be unique per user. Smart Filters are user-bound.
