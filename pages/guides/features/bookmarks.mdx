# Bookmarks

Bookmarks allow you to save individual pages (images) you want to revisit later. They can be accessed from the Bookmarks Library.

#### Removing Bookmarks
- To remove an individual bookmark, navigate back to the original file (the "View Series" button is useful for this) and remove the bookmark from the page.
- To remove all bookmarks from a series, open the context menu and click "Clear".

#### Downloading Bookmarks
- Bookmarks can be downloaded from each series' context menu by clicking "Download".
- If you have access to the filesystem, bookmarks can be downloaded from `config/bookmarks/`. The admin can set the location they want to use in the [Media Settings](../admin-settings/media.mdx#bookmarks-directory) tab.
