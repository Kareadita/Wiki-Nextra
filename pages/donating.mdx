# Donations

**I want to donate, what are my options?**

- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/kavita) - Transparent donations, money is used on supplies for project (this includes coffee, panels subscriptions, devices for testing, etc)
- [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/majora2007) - Good for one-time donations. 
- [Kavita+](kavita+) - This allows you to support the dev on a monthly recurring basis and get some cool features out of it at the same time.

Any donations are appreciated. Only Kavita+ removes the donate button on the sidenav.
