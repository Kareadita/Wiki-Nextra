## What is Kavita?
Kavita is an open-source, self-hosted digital library management system primarily designed for managing and reading comics, manga, and ebooks. It is built to provide a streamlined and user-friendly experience for organizing and accessing a personal collection of digital reading materials.

### Core Features

- **[Library Management](guides/admin-settings/libraries/)**: Organize your digital reading materials into a library with custom tags and filters.
- **Synchronized Reading**: Read your digital materials directly in your browser with a customizable reading experience.
- **[Custom Filters](guides/features/filtering/)**: Create custom filters to organize your library based on your own criteria.
- **[User Management](guides/admin-settings/users/)**: Create multiple users with different permissions to access your library, each with their own progress tracking.


## System Requirements

Kavita is built with Microsoft [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) and [Angular 18](https://v18.angular.dev/). Each of these technologies have their own requirements, but most modern systems should be fine. 

- [.NET Framework requirements](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/supported-os.md)
- [Angular requirements](https://v18.angular.dev/reference/versions#browser-support)

All Kavita builds are fully self-contained. This means there is no prerequisite software needed.

Users have reported running the app on as little as a single-core 1Ghz CPU and 256MB RAM. 

The only requirement Kavita has is the need for a CPU that supports SSE4.2 extensions. This is because of the upstream library `NetVIPS`. [See the FAQ](../troubleshooting/faq.mdx#q-what-is-the-netvips-dependency-and-what-does-it-mean-if-i-cant-run-it) for how to work around it.
